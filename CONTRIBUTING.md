# How to contribute to a hackweek project

There are many ways to contribute to a project and two of those are higlighted below.
We encourage participants to practice either one during an event and many open source 
projects have similar guides to contribute.

The two flows are:
* Contributing directly with a branch
* Contributing through a fork

### Which one to choose?
The way you can contribute and choose one of the above flows depends on your access 
privileges to a repository. You can use both flows, if you are part of the organization
that owns the repository. This is the case when you participate in the hackweek and
we added you to the GitHub organizaion. Once you are not part of the organization or 
if you want to contribute to a repository that is on someone else's personal account, 
then you need to use a fork.

### Terminology
Before we dive into the workflows, here some essential terms and links to definitions:
* [Branch](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/quickstart/github-glossary#branch)
* [Fork](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/quickstart/github-glossary#fork)
* [Pull Request or short PR](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/quickstart/github-glossary#pull-request)
* [Pull Request Review](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/quickstart/github-glossary#pull-request-review)
* [Push](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/quickstart/github-glossary#push)

## Contributing through a branch
The following explains the steps to [contribute directly to a repository using
a branch](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/quickstart/github-flow).

In a nutshell, here the steps:

1. Clone the repository

2. Create a branch
Choose a unique name that is not already taken in the repository and helps
other collaborators to identify your work.

3. Make your changes and commit them
Use your favorite editors in the terminal or through a user interface to
make your changes.

4. Push your branch to GitHub

5. Open your Pull Request on the GitHub.com

6. Once your Pull Request is merged, make sure to clean up and delete the branch
locally and on the website.

## Commit messages
Good commit messages for each change helps you and your collaborators.
